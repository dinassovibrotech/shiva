* [Simple Client Server](simple_client_server/README.md): A simple client-server application that sends and receives **tensors** and **metadata**.
* [Inference Server Demo](inference_server_demo/README.md): A simple inference server that receives a request from a client, processes it and returns a response. The client uses the **namespace** field of the message to specify the **command** to be executed, no **metadata** usage.
* [C++ Client](cpp_client/README.md): A simple client-server application where the client is implemented in C++ and the server in Python.
